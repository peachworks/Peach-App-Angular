// This code was refactored for later easy v2 ES6 transition:
// - using _this, later on declaration at the top and return statement at the very bottom should be removed, and all _this renamed to this
// - rename _constructor to constructor, and remove it's call from the bottom
// - update function declarations - remove _this. and 'function' keywords
// - update 'var' to 'let' where it has to be done, add const
// - rename all __this to _this
